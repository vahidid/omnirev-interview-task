# Omnirev Interview Task

Small Next.js (App Router) dashboard for testing the Omnirev UI and data interactions. It relies on React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, React Query, and a lightweight service layer that talks to the Omnirev mock API.

## Architecture & Folders
- `src/app` – Next.js routes, layouts, and global styles (`login`, `panel`, and root page).
- `src/features` – Feature-specific UIs (e.g., `dashboard`, `contacts`) composed of hooks + components.
- `src/components` – Reusable building blocks, shadcn-inspired primitives, and form widgets.
- `src/services` – Axios-powered API wrappers plus server actions for authentication.
- `src/hooks`, `src/utils`, `src/lib` – Cross-cutting hooks (React Query, forms), helpers (formatters, constants), and shared config.
- `src/models`, `src/types`, `src/assets` – Shared TypeScript models, global types, and static assets.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies (project uses `pnpm`, but npm/yarn also work):
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root and fill the values listed below.
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev        # development with Turbopack
   pnpm build      # production build
   pnpm start      # run the compiled app
   ```
4. Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Environment Variables
Add these to `.env` (same base URL can be used for both):

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `API_URL` | Base URL for server-side requests (e.g., `https://api-mock.omnirev.ai`). |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | Client-safe version of the same API URL so browser code can call it. |

Restart the dev server after editing `.env` to make sure the values are picked up.
